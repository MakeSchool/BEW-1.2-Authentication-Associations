# Making Queries

Now that we've got a basic understanding of the SQL language, let's try making some queries. This will allow us to retrieve data from a database table that matches a set of criteria.

For the below examples, assume that we have the following data set in the `Users` table:

TODO: table

To check out what you'll learn in this lesson, take a look at the Repl.it included below and try out the commands.

## The SELECT Statement

This statement selects _all_ rows from _all_ users from the `Users` table:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Users;
```

The asterisk character `*` acts as a wildcard to select _all_ rows from the table. If we only want to select a few specific rows, we can list them separated by commas.

This statement selects the first and last names (but not the ages) of all users in the `Users` table:

```sql
SELECT first_name, last_name FROM Users;
```

## The WHERE Clause

We can use the `WHERE` clause to select only the rows in the table which adhere to a certain boolean condition. The clause following the `WHERE` keyword is evaluated as a boolean expression, so we can use any valid operators like `<`, `>`, `<=`, and `>=` which return a boolean.

This statement selects all users from the `Users` table whose age is greater than 24:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Users WHERE age > 24;
```

Note that to check if a certain field is _equal_ to a particular value, we would use a single equals sign `=`:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Users WHERE first_name = 'Leonard';
```

## Logical Operators: AND, OR, NOT

We can also use the AND, OR, and NOT operators to form more complex conditions.

This statement selects all users whose last name is 'Cooper' _and_ who are older than 20:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Users WHERE last_name = 'COOPER' AND age > 20;
```

## The LIKE Operator

Sometimes, we want to look for an _inexact_ match in a text field, rather than an exact match. We can use the `LIKE` keyword, along with the wildcard character `%`, to do that.

Let's say we have the following data in the `Fruits` table:

| name | price | quantity |
|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| granny smith apple | 0.99 | 5 |
| banana | 0.69 | 10 |
| honeycrisp apple | 1.29 | 8 |
| mandarin orange | 0.89 | 5 |
| mango | 2.99 | 3 |

We could select all rows with names that end in the word `apple` with the following query:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Fruits WHERE name LIKE '%apple';
```

The wildcard character `%` matches to any number of characters when it's used with the `LIKE` operator, so any row with name ending in "apple" will be included.

If you want to select for rows that contain "apple" _anywhere_ in the name, and not just at the end (such as "apple pie"), you would need to use another wildcard character at the end of the string, like so:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Fruits WHERE name LIKE '%apple%';
```


## Challenge: Complete the Queries
