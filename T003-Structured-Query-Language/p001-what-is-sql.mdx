# What is SQL?

**SQL** (pronounced as "Sequel") stands for **Structured Query Language**. It is a programming language that is used to communicate directly with a database.

In a SQL database, **all data is stored in tables**. Unlike in NoSQL, we can't store arbitrary objects - only keys and values.

For example, this might be our Users table:

TODO: table

We could then write a **SQL query** to retrieve specific data from the database that satisfies a set of criteria. For example, to get all users who are at least age 25, I might write a query like this:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Users WHERE age >= 25;
```

Which might return a data set that looks like this:

TODO: table

## "Dialects" of SQL

SQL also isn't just one language. There are many different "dialects" of SQL, each of which has some minor differences. These include:

- MySQL
- Oracle
- PostgreSQL
- SQLite

The differences aren't too important, though - it's more important to understand the concepts so that you can apply them to any scenario.

## SQL vs. NoSQL

There are some important differences between SQL databases and NoSQL, or document-based, databases (such as MongoDB). A few of these are listed below:
