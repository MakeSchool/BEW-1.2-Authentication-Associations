# One-to-Many Relationships

In the world of data modeling, there are three types of relationships: **One-to-Many**, **Many-to-Many**, and **One-to-One**. We'll explore each of those in the following lessons.

## What is a One-to-Many Relationship?

A **one-to-many relationship** describes a scenario between entities `X` and `Y` as: "One X can have many Y, but one Y can only have one X".

Let's take an example: On a photo sharing website, one `User` can have many `Photo`s, but each `Photo` can belong to only one `User`.

To describe this type of relationship in a diagram, we use the cross and crow's foot symbols, as in the diagram above.

## Challenge: Owner & Pet

<FlashCard>
<Prompt>

Let's say you have been commissioned to build a database for a veterinary hospital, to model `Pet`s and `Owner`s. You will need to keep track of each `Owner`'s information, such as their name, address, phone number, etc, and each `Pet`'s information, such as their species, age, weight, etc.

**What should be the relationship between `Owner` and `Pet`?**

1. One-to-Many
1. Many-to-Many
1. One-to-One

</Prompt>
<Answer>

The relationship between `Owner` and `Pet` would be **One-to-Many**, because one Owner can have many Pets, but each Pet can have only one Owner.

Importantly, this is true **even if every single owner in the database has only one pet!** The relationship describes what is _possible_ to store in the database; it doesn't necessarily describe the actual data stored there.
