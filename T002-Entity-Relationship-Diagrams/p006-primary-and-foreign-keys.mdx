# Primary and Foreign Keys

The last piece of missing information in our understanding of entity relationship diagrams is **primary and foreign keys**. These are both special fields within an entity. The **primary key** is a special field we can use to look up an instance of an entity, and the **foreign key** denotes a relationship between entities.

## Primary Keys

A **primary key** is a field in an entity that can be used to uniquely identify each instance of the entity. Usually, this is an `id` field, but we can use another field instead as the primary key, such as a username.

To be used as a primary key, a field must be:

- Unique (e.g. no two users can have the same username)
- Not null (e.g. every user must have a username)
- Never changing (e.g. a user cannot modify their username)

Check your understanding by trying the examples below.

<Prompt>

Which if these would make a good primary key for a `User` entity?

- First and last name
- Phone number
- Email address
- Social security number

</Prompt>
<Answer>

The answer is that **none of these** would be suitable as a primary key field! Each of them fails at least one check.

- First and last name - Not unique! Two people could both be named "Joe Smyte".
- Phone number - Could change!
- Email address - Could change!
- Social security number - Not everyone has one!

We can label a primary field with PK in the entity relationship diagram, like in this example:
