# Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERDs)

Congratulations - you now understand all of the types of relationships we'll encounter in our database design! Now we're ready to draw up more comprehensive diagrams to describe _all_ of the relationships within a particular database schema.

We already have the necessary components to building an ERD - the _relationships_ - and now, we just need to put them together.

Let's first look at an example ERD to get an idea of what you'll build in this chapter.

## Why Make an ERD?

Think of an ERD as a roadmap for any project involving a database - it'll help you to figure out where you're going and avoid getting stuck when you're halfway there and having to backtrack. 

Visualizing the relationships before you start writing any code can help you to figure out what components you'll need.
